# Action Repository for Webhook Test

This repository is designed to trigger GitHub events like **Push**, **Pull Request**, and **Merge**, which are then sent to a webhook endpoint hosted in the `webhook-repo`. The events generated by this repository will be used for testing and showcasing the webhook integration.

## Features
- Generates GitHub webhook events for **Push**, **Pull Request**, and **Merge** actions.
- Sends these events to the webhook URL defined in the GitHub repository settings.
- Events are captured and displayed by the `webhook-repo` in the UI.

## Steps for Setting Up the Webhook

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/asu2sh/action-repo.git
    cd action-repo
    ```

2. **Configure the webhook**:
    - Go to the repository settings on GitHub: **Settings** > **Webhooks** > **Add webhook**.
    - Enter the webhook URL provided by your `webhook-repo` (for example, `https://<your-ngrok-id>.ngrok.io/webhook`).
    - Choose **application/json** as the content type.
    - Select the events: **Push**, **Pull Request**, and **Merge**.
    - Save the webhook.

3. **Trigger Events**:
    - **Push**: Make any code changes in this repository, and push them to the remote GitHub repository.
    - **Pull Request**: Open a pull request from one branch to another.
    - **Merge**: After a pull request is approved, merge it.

4. **Verify the Events**:
    - The events should be sent to the webhook URL, and you should see them displayed on the UI hosted by the `webhook-repo`.

## Testing the Webhook
- After pushing code, creating pull requests, or merging branches in this repository, check the UI of the `webhook-repo` to ensure the events are being captured and displayed.
